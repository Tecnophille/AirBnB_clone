# HolbertonBnB - API :round_pushpin:

The HolbertonBnB API is a complete, RESTful API built in Python Flask.

[Source code.](../api)

## Dependencies :couple:

| Tool/Library | Version |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Python       | ^3.6.4  |
| Flask        | ^1.0.3  |
| flasgger     | ^0.9.2  |
| Flask-Cors   | ^3.0.8  |

## Usage :running:

Assuming the above dependencies have been installed, the API can be started using the following command:

```
python3 api.v1.app:app
```

Of course, the API is truly only functional in conjunction with [models](./MODELS.md).

## Endpoints :light_rail:

I would document all of the HolbertonBnB API endpoints here... but I already have! With [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)!
